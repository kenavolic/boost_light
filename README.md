# boost_light

Provide customizable lightweight modules that can be included and tailored to your project
if your expectation (in terms of feature) are pretty low and you don't want to bother
including boost for such minimalist needs.

The expectation is just that each module must lie in a single header file. It has been developed pretty quickly thus don't expect something robust.

# Features

* lsm.h: light state machine that provides an independant header-only state machine module (minimal boost msm)
* lpo.h: light program option
* main.cpp: demo
